# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-1-D-CNN

In this project we're going to build eep neural networks base classifier in tensorflow using 1-D convolutional Neural Network based classifier to classify human activities into six classes : Jogging, Standing, Sitting, Downstairs, Upstairs and Walking. we'll perform our training using the WISDM dataset (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) which contains data of this six human activity classes and we'll evaluate our model using the state of art  matrices that its recall precision f1-score and accuracy, and we hope that we can further improve it in the future using  improvement in the model architecture by tuning the hyperparameter and the parameters of the model , using empirical training or empirical process.


WISDM dataset are avaible using on https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php,
